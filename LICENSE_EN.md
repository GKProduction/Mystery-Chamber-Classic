# GKProduction Open Source License v1.0
This license describes the permissible actions with the source code and the conditions that must be followed.
# Definitions and Terms
**"Current License"** — the present GKProduction Open Source License v1.0.

**"Source Code"** — the source file or collection of files provided by the author or copyright holder, representing the project in its initial unassembled/uncompiled form, available for free editing by the developer.

**"Media Resources"** — the collection of materials/files included in the Source Code. These include images (sprites), audio, video, and text. These may be resources created by the author or third-party resources not created by the author.

**"Modification"** — a modified version of the Source Code in which third-party changes have been made.

**"Build"** — an executable file or application that has been assembled or compiled from a Modification. This definition includes working software, applications, mobile applications, and web applications.

**"Project"** — the project to which the Source Code belongs, and to which this license applies.
# Source Code
## Permitted Actions
You are allowed to download, view, and modify the Source Code of the Project. Documentation of the Source Code (e.g., creating documentation or articles on wiki resources) is permitted. Selling, reselling, or any other commercial use of the Source Code is prohibited.
## Distribution
Republishing the Source Code on other resources is allowed only with mandatory attribution and a link to the original source.
# Media Resources
## Permitted Actions
You are allowed to download, view, and modify Media Resources within the scope of a Modification, provided that the authorship of these resources belongs to the copyright holder of the Source Code or their partners (usually indicated in the Project/Source Code under the "Authors" section).
## Distribution
Publishing author-created Media Resources on wiki projects (e.g., hosted on Fandom, wiki.gg, etc.) dedicated to the projects and activities of the author is permitted. Their use in Modifications, Builds, and non-commercial fan works is also allowed.

Republishing Media Resources on any other web resources without attribution and a link to the original source is prohibited. The use of author-created Media Resources in third-party projects (not being Modifications) without the author's consent is prohibited.
# Modifications and Builds
## Permitted Actions
You may download, view, modify, share, and publish Modifications and their Builds, provided you adhere to the following conditions.
### Features and Purposes
These conditions concern the features of the Modification and the purposes for which it is created.
- Significant changes must have been made to the Source Code when creating the Modification, meaning the Modification should not be a copy of the Source Code and must differ from it. Such changes may include bug fixes or the addition of new features or content. Changes may be considered insignificant if, for example, only a few pixels, lines, or a single non-functional object were altered in the Source Code;
- The Modification and Build must not be created to bypass the developer's internal restrictions, especially if the bypass is for fraudulent purposes (e.g., inflating values or results);
- The Modification and Build must not affect the saved data of the Project. Such data includes save files and settings. The Modification must use a different location for saving data. Automatic import of the Project's saved data into the new location used by the Modification is allowed;
- Attribution/credit to the author of the Source Code or Project (including authors of the Source Codes on which the Modification is based) must be preserved in the Modification and Build in the same manner as in the Source Code;
- If the Modification or Build can easily be mistaken for a standalone product or confused with the Source Code or its build (game), the Modification should prominently display links to the author of the Source Code and/or their build (game);
- The name of the Build must not match the name of the official build of the Source Code;
- The Build must not use the same package name as the official build;
- Monetization and commercial use of the Modification and its Builds (e.g., by embedding ads, in-app purchases, or simply selling the Modification, Build, or content for them) are prohibited. However, collecting donations (on platforms like Patreon, Boosty, Ko-fi, etc.) is allowed.
## Distribution
The author of the Modification may open and maintain a fork of the official Source Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and publish versions of their Modifications and Builds there. It is also allowed to open and maintain forks of other Modifications' repositories, provided the license of the Modification permits it.

Both the publication of Builds and Modifications is allowed. For their distribution, all conditions must be met, including the following:
- Publication of Builds is prohibited in digital stores such as Google Play, RuStore, Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG.com, VK Play, etc. (even if the Build is published as a free application);
- Publication of Modifications and Builds is allowed on resources dedicated to indie games, on your personal website, and in cloud storage;
- The author of the original Source Code and a link to the original source must be indicated on the page or in the description of the source where the Modification or Build is published.

Recommended platforms for publication:

# License Application
This license applies to the Source Code. Modifications and Builds must be licensed either under the Current License or under the license of the Modification's author, preserving the same conditions as the Current License. Their license must not conflict with the Current License.

Non-compliance with the conditions and any conflict between the Modification's license and the Current License will be considered a violation of the Current License.

The Source Code is provided "as is," without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Under no circumstances shall the author or copyright holder be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from the Source Code, as well as from derivative Modifications and Builds, its use, or other dealings with it or in connection with it.
